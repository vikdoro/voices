			"paragraph1": "Rose and Jack came from very different walks of life. However, at some point, their paths crossed; they were both deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Even though they were in the same place at the same time, later they invoked the past in a contrasting manner. Both Rose and Jack gave an oral history testimony in the 1990s, but their stories, as well as the non-verbal layer of their memories, were very different.",
			"paragraph2": "Inspired by these differences, we compare how thousands of women and men survivors remembered life in Auschwitz. We use a multimodal approach supported by artificial intelligence; we investigate not only the textual content of testimonies; we also study the voice, the eye movement, the body posture, and other non-verbal gestures of survivors recalling a troubled past."
