# Performance Optimization Guide

## FOUC Elimination & Performance Best Practices

### What We've Implemented

#### 1. Critical CSS Inlining ✅
- Added critical above-the-fold styles directly in the HTML `<head>`
- Prevents FOUC by ensuring essential styles load immediately
- Includes navigation, layout, and base styles

#### 2. Resource Preloading ✅
- Preloaded critical font file (`ClashDisplay-Variable.woff2`)
- Preloaded logo image
- Added DNS prefetch and preconnect hints

#### 3. Font Loading Optimization ✅
- Changed `font-display` to `block` for better control
- Font Loading API detects when custom font is ready
- Prevents layout shifts and improves perceived performance
- Graceful fallback to system fonts if loading fails

#### 4. Font-Based Text Visibility ✅
- Text remains hidden until custom font loads
- No loading screen - content appears smoothly when ready
- Font Loading API ensures proper timing
- 2-second timeout fallback for better UX

#### 5. Build Optimization ✅
- Configured CSS code splitting in Vite
- Optimized chunk splitting for vendor libraries
- Improved asset file naming for better caching

### Additional Recommendations

#### 1. Image Optimization
```html
<!-- Add to your ResponsivePicture component -->
<img 
  src="image.webp" 
  loading="lazy" 
  decoding="async"
  alt="Description"
>
```

#### 2. Service Worker for Caching
Consider implementing a service worker for:
- Offline functionality
- Aggressive caching of static assets
- Background sync for better UX

#### 3. Critical Resource Hints
```html
<!-- Add these to index.html for better performance -->
<link rel="modulepreload" href="/src/main.ts">
<link rel="preload" href="/src/styles/main.scss" as="style">
```

#### 4. Lazy Loading Components
```javascript
// In your router.ts
const Home = () => import('./pages/Home.vue')
const People = () => import('./pages/People.vue')
const Output = () => import('./pages/Output.vue')
```

#### 5. Background Image Optimization
Consider using CSS `content-visibility: auto` for off-screen elements:
```css
.glass-1, .glass-2, .glass-3 {
  content-visibility: auto;
  contain-intrinsic-size: 346px 608px;
}
```

### Google PageSpeed Insights Optimization

#### Core Web Vitals Improvements
1. **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**
   - Preload critical images
   - Optimize background images
   - Use `fetchpriority="high"` for above-the-fold images

2. **FID (First Input Delay)**
   - Code splitting reduces main thread blocking
   - Lazy load non-critical JavaScript

3. **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**
   - Font loading optimization prevents layout shifts
   - Reserve space for dynamic content

#### Performance Metrics
- **FOUC**: Eliminated with critical CSS
- **Font Loading**: Optimized with `font-display: optional`
- **Resource Loading**: Improved with preload hints
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with code splitting

### Testing Your Optimizations

1. **Build and test locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Test with Google PageSpeed Insights**:
   - Run on both mobile and desktop
   - Check Core Web Vitals scores
   - Verify no FOUC in the visual timeline

3. **Monitor in production**:
   - Use Google Analytics Core Web Vitals
   - Set up Real User Monitoring (RUM)
   - Monitor with tools like WebPageTest

### Why This Approach is Better Than FOUC

1. **User Experience**: No jarring visual changes
2. **Accessibility**: Screen readers work properly from the start
3. **SEO**: Better user experience signals
4. **Performance**: Actually faster perceived performance
5. **Professional**: Maintains visual consistency

### Next Steps

1. Test the current implementation
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
3. Consider implementing additional optimizations based on real-world performance data
4. Set up performance monitoring and alerting

Remember: The goal is to provide the best user experience while maintaining excellent performance metrics. FOUC-free loading with optimized performance is achievable and recommended for production applications.
